					Hi, my name is John Nowinsky.	
				</p>				
				<p>
					I am an Air Force brat. I went to more schools than I can count. It was tough going from one school to another. Making new friends at every new stop but no lasting friends. I would not trade the experience though. It was a chance to see many new places that many never have the opportunity to.
				</p>				
				<p>
					I discovered computers from my dad. He was an electronic hobbyist which meant subscriptions to Popular and Radio Electronics. About the time I was about to enter high school. They came out with articles on the Altair and I was hooked on the possibilities.
				</p>	
				<p>
					I entered highschool and I enrolled in a computer class. As luck would have it the school purchased 3 Apple IIs and hired a burned out IBM programmer to teach the class. This is when I realized my calliing. I wanted to get into computers
				</p>
				<p>
					I searched for colleges and at the time the only one offering a computer program geared to business was Devry Institude of Technology. I enrolled and graduated.
				</p>
				<p>
					My career has taken me away from programming into more of the computer hardware and software support roles. My passion for programming never left though. I taught myself html and css to build and host some music websites.
				</p>
				<p>
					This only served to reignite my desire to return to programming. Realizing the new programming is on the internet. I'm enrolled in the University of Texas Boot Camp to become a full stack web developer.
